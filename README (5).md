# ERC20 Token Creation and Deployment

In this project, we are developing a custom token utilizing the ERC-20 standard within the Remix IDE. Our focus is on implementing essential functions such as minting, burning, and transferring.

## how to execute?

Certainly, here are the rearranged steps for your convenience:

**Step-by-Step Guide: Setting Up and Using the Smart Contract**

**Step 1:** Install all required dependencies by executing the `npm install` command.

**Step 2:** Using the terminal, navigate to your project directory.

**Step 3:** Compile the contract by running the `npx hardhat compile` command.

**Step 4:** Open the localhost network with the command `npx hardhat node`.

**Step 5:** In another terminal within the same directory, execute the `remixd` command.

**Step 6:** Access Remix via your web browser and modify the workspace to the local host workspace.

**Step 7:** Compile the contract within Remix.

**Step 8:** Change the environment in Remix to "Dev-Hardhat Provider" and proceed to deploy the smart contract.

By methodically following these steps and ensuring the installation of all necessary dependencies, you'll gain access to the Smart Contract's features, including Minting, Burning, and Transferring tokens.

**NOTE:** Remember that only the contract owner holds the authority to mint tokens to any given address.
